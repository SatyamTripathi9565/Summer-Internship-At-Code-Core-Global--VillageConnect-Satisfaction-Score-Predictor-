# Summer-Internship-At-Code-Core-Global--VillageConnect-Satisfaction-Score-Predictor-
A Machine Learning project to predict **Satisfaction Score** for rural services (Electricity, Internet, Water, Healthcare) using the **VillageConnect** dataset.   The model is deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web app** so users can try predictions in real time.
## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering with polynomial features
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Model training with **XGBoost Regressor**
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**
- Model evaluation with **MSE** and **R² Score**
- Interactive prediction via **Streamlit**
- Correlation heatmap visualization
